USABLE resources focus on supporting maintainers of OSS, developer contributors and OSS tool teams to better understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

USABLE is a collaboration between [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/), [Okthanks](https://okthanks.com/) and [nternews](https://internews.org/) looking to build resources for OSS tool teams to help them understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

This guide and FAQ focuses on user testing and how 'user testing can be fun'.  We built this as an interactive clickable 'game' (created in [SugarCube](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/) using [Twine](https://twinery.org/) thanks Twine!) so you can follow through with our coder squirrel Hex as they learn all about user testing.
