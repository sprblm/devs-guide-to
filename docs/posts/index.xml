      <description>After creating the third resource in our user testing series all about the synthesis processes, we wanted to make sure the information was clear so that real OSS tool teams could run and participate in a synthesis process of their own.
In our pilot with three team members of unrelated OSS tools, we used sample content from a previous OSS tool user research study. We had the hypothesis that any OSS tool team member could participate in the synthesis process, regardless of their familiarity with the tool or the research.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;After creating the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/synthesis-for-open-source/&#34;&gt;third resource in our user testing series&lt;/a&gt; all about the synthesis processes, we wanted to make sure the information was clear so that real OSS tool teams could run and participate in a synthesis process of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our pilot with three team members of unrelated OSS tools, we used sample content from a previous OSS tool user research study. We had the hypothesis that any OSS tool team member could participate in the synthesis process, regardless of their familiarity with the tool or the research. We wanted to convey that synthesis allows everyone to gain a better understanding of the achievements of the user testing/user research and &amp;lsquo;get on the same page&amp;rsquo; as those that conducted/observed the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took our OSS tool team participants through the general theory of synthesis of user testing/user research phase. It was important to reiterate the goals of the user testing/user research. We then offered the participants three kinds of user testing/user research outputs (video, long-form notes, short-form notes) and did a preliminary synthesis of each output before doing a wider synthesis and grouping/theming exercise. Due to time constraints, we conducted this session in 90 minutes. This demonstrates what can be achieved in a short amount of time with a dedicated synthesis process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop led to the creation of the resource &lt;a href=&#34;https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/synthesis-for-open-source/&#34;&gt;Synthesis for open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After creating the third resource in our user testing series about the synthesis process and running a small workshop session to test the content with real OSS tool teams, our talk about research synthesis was accepted by the Open Source Design devroom at FOSDEM 2022.
During the 20-minute talk, we took our audience through the process of creating resources for the USABLE.tools project and why we focussed on creating the first three resources around the user testing process before delving into the synthesis resource in detail.</description>

&lt;p&gt;During the 20-minute talk, we took our audience through the process of creating resources for the USABLE.tools project and why we focussed on creating the first three resources around the user testing process before delving into the synthesis resource in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explained why synthesis is an important phase not only for designers in OSS tool building, but the wider OSS tool team. As we discovered through many of our initial interviews with OSS tool team members, it can be difficult to understand the value design brings to an OSS tool, as well as where design improvements and insights come from. Along with these challenges, an additional challenge of developers in OSS is finding time to participate in user testing. However, a good synthesis session condenses this information. This also gives the designers and developers in OSS tool teams time to collaborate and understand each others&#39; perspectives and roles in making the best OSS tool possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/osd_synthesising_user_testing_insights_with_oss_tool_teams/&#34;&gt;video of the session that is self-hosted by FOSDEM here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensourcedesign.net/&#34;&gt;Open Source Design&lt;/a&gt; for inviting us to present at FOSDEM 2022!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Resource #3: Synthesis for open source
The third resource in our user testing series is all about the synthesis process. After conducting a series of user tests, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to put together and reorganize the data that came out of them - that&amp;rsquo;s synthesis. During a user test, you might get a few &amp;ldquo;Aha!&amp;rdquo; moments, but there also will be insights that you need to piece together. Through synthesis, you&amp;rsquo;ll be considering themes, connections, triggers, and what&amp;rsquo;s missing.</description>

Through synthesis, you&amp;rsquo;ll be considering themes, connections, triggers, and what&amp;rsquo;s missing. It&amp;rsquo;s important to make sense of a user test both on an individual level, and as a team. This synthesis resource specifically helps teams work together to find a common understanding that serves as the foundation of future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this resource, we documented the setup process, how to do affinity diagramming, and facilitating synthesis. We had a lot of fun connecting the information to our experiences working in open source, and included several real life examples. After a synthesis process, the next steps for your team are prioritization and sharing out. We mentioned these briefly, but look forward to expanding this content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We highlighted this resource during the engagements:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Collaboration processes came up in our initial research interviews with tool team members. Without prior experience of collaboration between design and development, OSS tool teams found it difficult to understand what good collaboration means and looks like.
For our fourth resource and engagement with the OSS community we wanted to facilitate (and participate in) an honest and clear conversation between designers and developers with various experience in OSS. This conversation was held on the Sustaining Open Source Design podcast (SOS Design).</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Collaboration processes came up in our initial research interviews with tool team members.  Without prior experience of collaboration between design and development, OSS tool teams found it difficult to understand what good collaboration means and looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our fourth resource and engagement with the OSS community we wanted to facilitate (and participate in) an honest and clear conversation between designers and developers with various experience in OSS. This conversation was held on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sosdesign.sustainoss.org/&#34;&gt;Sustaining Open Source Design podcast (SOS Design)&lt;/a&gt;. This podcast is a sibling podcast to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://podcast.sustainoss.org/&#34;&gt;Sustain OSS podcast&lt;/a&gt; where hosts and guests discuss what it means to keep OSS thriving and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the conversation about how designers and developers collaborate on OSS tools, we invited &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yrb1rd&#34;&gt;Sadie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://luwuxu.com/&#34;&gt;Lucie&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://geti2p.net/en/&#34;&gt;I2P (Invisible Internet Project)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://saptaks.website/&#34;&gt;Saptak&lt;/a&gt;, a Human Rights Concerned Web Developer, working as a contractor with Freedom of the Press Foundation. We discussed questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where does the designer-developer handoff (or better yet, collaboration) begin in your opinion?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve used the word &amp;lsquo;hand-off&amp;rsquo; but does that narrative need to change? Should hand-off be more like a &amp;lsquo;hands together&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have an example of when designer-developer collaboration has worked really well? What does the easiest design spec you&amp;rsquo;ve worked from look like? Which collaboration method with designers do you prefer as you work through implementation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simplysecure/designer-developer-collaboration-in-OSS/blob/main/In-conversation-with-designers-and-developers-in-OSS-for-SOS-podcast.md&#34;&gt;transcript of the podcast episode here in an open github repository&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simplysecure/designer-developer-collaboration-in-OSS&#34;&gt;repository readme also has a detailed list of questions&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of developer and designer collaboration in OSS (some of which we covered and some we didn&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to join us for a future part of the conversation on designer and developer collaboration in OSS you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/design-ux-working-group/348&#34;&gt;contact the SOS Design podcast here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can listen to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sosdesign.sustainoss.org/18&#34;&gt;SOS Design podcast episode &amp;lsquo;Collaboration Between Designers and Developers&amp;rsquo; here on the podcast&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>What is this guide? This guide focuses on informal, DIY, beginner user testing in a process that’s not rigorous but extremely valuable. As a short and practical guide, it helps teams get started, but shouldn’t be used to shift into a career of user research.
Who is it for? We wrote this guide with small (2-20 active contributors or maintainers), open source teams in mind. Even if you don’t have a dedicated designer or researcher on your team, user testing can be achievable (and fun!</description>

      <description>From December 6th to 10th 2021, Kelsey, Eriol, and Hex took over the IMakeFOSS Twitter account to share the first USABLE resource &amp;ldquo;User testing can be fun&amp;rdquo;.
Founded by Jason Evangelho and Jochen Spang, IMakeFOSS is a Twitter account and website that gives a voice to open source projects around the world by letting contributors takeover the Tweeting on a weekly basis. Tweets are archived not only on Twitter, but the well-organized website.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Founded by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KillYourFM&#34;&gt;Jason Evangelho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/josp0001&#34;&gt;Jochen Spang&lt;/a&gt;, IMakeFOSS is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/imakefoss&#34;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://imakefoss.org/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that gives a voice to open source projects around the world by letting contributors takeover the Tweeting on a weekly basis. Tweets are archived not only on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/imakefoss&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but the well-organized &lt;a href=&#34;https://imakefoss.org/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really great experience interacting with the community and sharing the UX side of OSS development. Behind the scenes, Kelsey and Eriol prepped the &lt;a href=&#34;https://imakefoss.org/tweets/eriolandkelsey/&#34;&gt;Tweets and images&lt;/a&gt;, responded to comments, and overall had a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the takeover, Eriol and Kelsey (camouflaged as Fox and Skunk) participated in an &lt;a href=&#34;https://imakefoss.org/curators/eriolfoxandkelseysmith/&#34;&gt;interview to introduce&lt;/a&gt; themselves to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re thankful that to UX designers got the chance to share our message about user testing. Thanks, IMakeFOSS!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>We wanted to make sure that folks who prefer a &amp;lsquo;static&amp;rsquo; resource for the &amp;lsquo;User testing can be fun: An FAQ for small open source teams&amp;rsquo; can have access to the insights and advice too, which is why we made a poster for download and sharing as a digital resource or printing to put up in a workspace.
The poster version doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an internet connection to play (like the &amp;lsquo;User testing can be fun: An FAQ interactive guide&#39;) as we recognise that not everyone globally has access to a stable connection all of the time and might just want a &amp;lsquo;static&amp;rsquo; version of the FAQ tips and advice.</description>

USABLE resources focus on supporting maintainers of OSS, developer contributors and OSS tool teams to better understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.
USABLE is a collaboration between Simply Secure, Okthanks and Internews looking to build resources for OSS tool teams to help them understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Want to &amp;lsquo;fork&amp;rsquo; the Twine HTML code for this game and make your own additions and changes? or found a bug you want to log? You can find the code and an issue tracker on this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simplysecure/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also find the &amp;lsquo;static&amp;rsquo; poster version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/posts/user-testing-can-be-fun/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ for small open source teams&amp;rsquo; here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
